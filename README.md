# PySpammer

**PySpammer** is a simple Python file that once run, it will prompt you to set a custom message, custom loop amount, and a custom color for both the foreground and background. I made this for fun and for my senior year **Computer Programming II** class.

Please also note: this app currently only works on **WINDOWS.**

## How to Run

There are two ways you can run PySpammer. Both will require you to install the project as a .zip, which you can do by going to **Code > Download ZIP**.

### Manual Method
NOTE: THIS METHOD **REQUIRES** YOU TO HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED.

1. Extract the ZIP folder.
2. Open the command prompt.
3. Change your directory to the PySpammer folder (cd [path of folder])
4. Enter "python spammer.py" (without quotations)
5. Enjoy!

### Auto Method

1. Extract the ZIP folder.
2. Run (double-click) "spamrun"
3. Enjoy!

I hope you enjoy tinkering with this as much as I did making it!
